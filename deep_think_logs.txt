üß† Deep Think response:
Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants to transform OCR-scanned Polish quiz content into clean JSON. The example provided has a question about integration mechanisms and four answer options labeled with letters.

First, I need to follow the rules strictly. Each object must have a "question" string and an "answers" array with objects containing "text" and "correct". Since the correct answers are typically only one, but in this case, all are set to false except for option C.

I notice the original example has "correct": false for each answer except "C". So, I should structure it similarly. Also, the additional guidelines mention correcting OCR errors and ensuring Polish grammar is fluent.

I'll start by extracting the question and its options, making sure to clean up any typos or formatting issues from the OCR scan. The question seems complete with four answers, so it fits the criteria.

Next, I'll format this into a JSON array as specified, ensuring each answer has "text" and "correct". Only option C should have "correct": true. 

I also need to avoid using any markdown and strictly follow JSON syntax to prevent parsing errors. Including all necessary fields without extra keys like "options" is crucial.

After structuring, I'll review the JSON for correctness, making sure it's valid and adheres to the user's guidelines.

Alright, I'm looking at this user query where they want to transform messy OCR-scanned Polish quiz content into clean JSON. The user provided an example and specific rules. First, I need to parse the input text.

I see two sections labeled "Zakonczona" which probably means completed. Each has a question number and some options. For the first question, it's numbered 2 with a score of 0/1. The question is about what czech √† magistralus ustug is. There are five answer choices: a to e.

I need to create a JSON object for this question. The key points are:
- Extract the question text accurately.
- Identify each answer option, assign "text" and set "correct": false.
- Ensure all answers have at least two options.

Wait, in the example response, only four answers were included. But the input has five. Should I include all? The rules say to include all if more than four, so yes.

For the second section, it's labeled Pytanie: 3 with a score of 1/1. It mentions "Pytanie 2" but the answer options are unclear and probably incomplete. According to the guidelines, I should ignore incomplete questions. So this one won't be included in the JSON.

I'll structure the first question into the JSON format as shown. Each answer will have "text" and "correct": false since none are correct unless specified. 

Let me make sure all Polish words are correctly OCR'd and any errors fixed. The translation seems accurate, so I can proceed without changes.

Finally, ensure the JSON is an array of objects, no extra keys, and strict formatting to avoid parsing issues.
